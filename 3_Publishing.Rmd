## Publishing and sharing
Once you've made an app, you can share them via:
- web-based apps
- online dashboards
- [embed them in Markdown files](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown-formats.html)

## To share them online:
- install `rsconnect` 
- sign up for a shinyapps.io account (instructions [here](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html))
- get your token and publish straight from RStudio
