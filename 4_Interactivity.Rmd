# Other useful tips and tricks
 - `print()` to the RStudio console to confirm that objects are what you think they are
 - if you want to save data or outputs and use in several server operations, use `reactive` 
 - use `kableExtra` to make nice tables
  - if you use ggplot, define your plots thus:
```
output$ggplotoutput <- renderPlot({
  myplot <- ggplot(dat,aes(x=variable,y=value)) +
          geom_point() 
        myplot
})
```
