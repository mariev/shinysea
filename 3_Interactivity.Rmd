## Bringing data into Shiny
If you want to design your app so that people can bring in their own data:

Add a file upload input in the UI using the function `fileInput()`, e.g. `fileInput('mydata')`. In the server function, access the uploaded files via `input$mydata`:
```
ui <- fluidPage(

  # App title ----
  titlePanel("Uploading Files"),
  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions ----
  sidebarLayout(
    # Sidebar panel for inputs ----
    sidebarPanel(
      # Input: Select a file ----
      fileInput("file1", "Choose CSV File",
                multiple = FALSE,
                accept = c("text/csv",
                         "text/comma-separated-values,text/plain",
                         ".csv")),
```
