## Bringing data into Shiny
If you want to design your app so that people can bring in their own data:

Add a file upload input in the UI using the function `fileInput()`. In the `server` function, access the uploaded files via `input$mydata`:
```
ui <- fluidPage(
  # App title ----
  titlePanel("Uploading Files"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      fileInput("mydata", "Choose CSV File",
                multiple = FALSE,
                accept = c("text/csv",
                         "text/comma-separated-values,text/plain",
                         ".csv")),
```

## Getting data out of Shiny
You can download data from a Shiny app using`downloadLink()` in the ui and `downloadHandler()` in the server:

```
ui <- fluidPage(
  downloadLink("downloadData", "Download")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  # Our dataset
  data <- mtcars

  output$downloadData <- downloadHandler(
    filename = function() {
      paste("data-", Sys.Date(), ".csv", sep="")
    },
    content = function(file) {
      write.csv(data, file)
    }
  )
}
```


## Getting data out of Shiny
- Download CSV or txt files from Shiny apps
- Generate reports in Markdown that are knitted to html files (details on how to do that [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/generating-reports.html))
- You can also download images that have been generated in the app (e.g., download plots from the app)
